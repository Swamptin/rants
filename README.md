# rants
  
A collection of rants and email templates. These are being shared as I feel that with enough people emailing enough people detailing the same problems, we might actually see change.  
  
These are all to be considered working documents. If I have made a mistake or an assumption that is not fair, please feel free to get in touch and I can address it.
